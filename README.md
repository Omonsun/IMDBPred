# 📈 Machine Learning Regression Models  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores various **machine learning regression models** to predict a continuous target variable. Different regression techniques, including **linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods**, are compared based on their predictive accuracy and generalization performance.  

### ✅ **Objectives**  
- Implement and compare different **regression models**.  
- Evaluate performance using **error metrics** such as MSE, MAE, and R² score.  
- Optimize models using **hyperparameter tuning**.  
- Visualize results and interpret feature importance.

## 📂 **Dataset**  
The dataset contains numerical features used to predict a continuous output variable.

📌 **Preprocessing Steps:**  
- Handling missing values  
- Feature scaling (normalization/standardization)  
- Train-test split

## ⚙️ **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**  
- **Scikit-Learn** (for regression models & evaluation)  
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)
